Voice Assistant Application
Overview
The Voice Assistant Application is a Python-based desktop application that integrates voice recognition and text-to-speech functionality into a graphical user interface (GUI). The application uses the speech_recognition library for capturing and converting voice commands into text, pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, and tkinter for the graphical interface.

Features
Voice Input: Capture voice commands using a microphone.
Text Display: Show the recognized text in a scrollable text area.
Text-to-Speech: Read out the recognized text and respond to commands.
Command Processing: Recognize and handle specific commands, such as "stop" to end the program.
Installation
To set up the application, you'll need Python installed on your system. The following Python packages are required:

speech_recognition
pyttsx3
tkinter (typically included with Python standard library)
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3
Usage
Run the Application: Execute the Python script to launch the GUI.
Interact with the Application:
Click the "Listen" button to start capturing voice input.
The recognized text will be displayed in the text area and spoken back to you.
If the recognized text contains the word "stop", the application will stop processing further commands.
Code Description
VoiceAssistantApp Class
__init__(self, root): Initializes the GUI components and sets up the recognizer and text-to-speech engine.
capture_voice_input(self): Captures audio from the microphone.
convert_voice_to_text(self, audio): Converts the captured audio to text using Google Speech Recognition.
speak_text(self, text): Converts the text to speech and speaks it.
process_voice_command(self, text): Processes the recognized text to handle commands and updates the text area.
start_listening(self): Starts the voice capture process and handles the recognized text.
Running the Code
Save the code to a file named voice_assistant.py.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing voice_assistant.py.
Run the script using Python:
bash
Copy code
python voice_assistant.py
Example
When you run the application and click the "Listen" button, the application will wait for you to speak. After you speak, the application will display and read out the recognized text. If you say "stop", the application will stop processing and terminate.

Troubleshooting
No Sound from Microphone: Ensure that your microphone is properly connected and configured in your system settings.
Speech Recognition Errors: Check your internet connection as Google Speech Recognition requires an online connection.
Application Not Responding: Ensure that all required packages are installed and there are no syntax errors in the code.
